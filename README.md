# MERN Stack Single-Page Application

## Project Overview

This project is a MERN-stack single-page application designed to address a real-world challenge using data-driven insights and user-centric features. The application is built with a focus on seamless interactivity, polished design, and modern development practices. It demonstrates proficiency in problem-solving and technical skills essential for industry-standard development.

## Key Features

- **Front-End:** Developed using React to provide a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Back-End:** Built with Node.js and Express.js, incorporating GraphQL for data queries and mutations.
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Authentication:** Secure user authentication implemented with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Deployment:** Fully deployed on Render with live data integration.
- **Interactivity:** Interactive features that accept and respond to user input in real-time.
- **Responsiveness:** Designed to adapt seamlessly across devices and screen sizes.
- **Security:** Sensitive API key information securely managed on the server.
